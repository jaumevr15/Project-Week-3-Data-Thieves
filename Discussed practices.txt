- Using 4 spaces or tabulation for indexing

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

- Imports should usually be on separate lines.

- Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!

- Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).

- Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.

- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

- Names of type variables introduced in PEP 484 should normally use - - CapWords preferring short names: T, AnyStr, Num. It is recommended to add suffixes _co or 
_contra to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly.

- Designing for Inheritance: Always decide whether a class's methods and instance variables (collectively: "attributes") should be public or non-public. If in doubt, choose non-public; it's easier to make it public later than to make a public attribute non-public.

- Function and Method Arguments: Always use self for the first argument to instance methods. & Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.

- Function and Variable Names: Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
